# Case study at a glance
Digitalization does not stop at city tours – and the city of Zug shows how it’s done. With CityBot, the “city in your pocket,” Zug has created a digital visitor experience in recent years that is informative, individual, and data-driven.

Three factors are key to success and are described in detail below:
1. **A smart recommendation system** – The CityBot Recommender System (CBRS) adapts suggestions to the time of day, interests, and location without storing personal data. Guests find the best café in the morning, exciting sights at midday, and the right restaurant in the evening.

2. **Attractive, locally curated content** – Eight themed tours, from the “Cherry Tour” to the “Crypto Tour,” and over 560 points of interest in nine categories ensure variety. Lesser-known places are also highlighted – such as the Tschuepisweid, which became a hidden gem thanks to the “Munis & Lölis” tour.

3. **Measurable impact** – Since its launch in 2023, CityBot in Zug has recorded over 6,000 downloads, thousands of on-site interactions, and clear insights into which content is most popular. Top tours like “Washwomen & Bathers” attract hundreds of visitors, while conversion data shows that sights often lead from recommendations to real visits.

The following explains how CityBot works in Zug, which content makes the difference, and what the figures reveal about its success – a best practice any city can adapt for its own digital visitor guidance.

# 1. The CityBot Recommender System – Digital city tours that think along
In an era when visitors expect digital solutions, CityBot is a game-changer. At its heart: the CityBot Recommender System (CBRS). This system analyzes which content is relevant for which person at which moment – and offers suggestions that improve the on-site experience.  
But how does it work without infringing on privacy?

## How CBRS generates recommendations
The algorithm is based on three core sources of information:

- **Content**: Tours, points of interest (POIs), events that are suggested

- **Conditions**: Time of day, weather, and the user’s location

- **Interactions**: Which content users click, save, or visit in person.

Important: No personal data such as name or address is stored. Instead, CBRS uses anonymous user IDs, location points (without linking to private addresses), and category preferences. This means CityBot can be used without concern even in privacy-sensitive regions.

## Time of day + preferences = tailored tips
CityBot analyzes what makes sense at which time:

- Morning: Cafés, shopping, walks.

- Midday: Sights, culture, outdoor highlights.

- Evening: Restaurants, bars, events.

The system also learns individual preferences – e.g., a high affinity for art, a neutral attitude toward nature, or a low preference for bars. These adjustments happen automatically or manually by the user.

💡 **Mini-Success Story:**  
In Zug, this logic led day visitors to extend their stay – breakfast by the lake, art museum in the afternoon, dinner in the old town. This not only increased the length of stay but also the economic impact per visit.

## Added value for cities
- **Targeted visitor management**: Directing visitor flows to avoid overcrowding.

- **Visibility for hidden gems**: Lesser-known POIs can be deliberately highlighted.

- **Flexibility**: Cities can adapt the recommendation logic to their goals, e.g., focusing more on culture or nature.

👉 **Conclusion**: CBRS is not just a technical gimmick – it is a strategic tool for any city that wants to manage its tourism smartly.

# 2. Zug in the best light: The content that brings CityBot to life

Why content is key: A digital city guide is only as attractive as the content it offers. The city of Zug recognized early that varied, locally rooted content is the decisive success factor.

## 8 curated tours – Expertise from the region
Each tour in CityBot was developed by local experts: historians, cultural figures, journalists. Examples:

- Cherries & Cakes – The Cherry Tour (14 POIs, 2.2 km): Enjoyment and history around Zug’s specialties.

- Washwomen & Bathers – The Old Town Tour (14 POIs, 0.5 km): Fascinating anecdotes from the heart of the city.

- Elections & Debates – The Democracy Tour (17 POIs, 2.5 km): Political places and their stories.

- Bitcoin, Ethereum & Blockchain – The Crypto Tour (15 POIs, 2.0 km): The tech side of Zug, the “Crypto Valley.”

All tours last between 1 and 2 hours – ideal for spontaneous city explorers.

## 562 points of interest in 9 categories
From art (200 POIs) to sights (140) to smaller categories like nature or sports, CityBot covers all aspects of a tourism offering.  
The geographical distribution ensures that visitors don’t just stay at the classic hotspots but also discover side locations.

💡 **Mini-Success Story**: The “Munis & Lölis” tour took visitors to the northern cemetery for the first time – a historic site that had previously received little tourist attention.

## Why this content strategy works
- Variety prevents monotony and increases app usage.

- Local expertise ensures authenticity.

- Geographical spread directs visitors to different parts of the city.

👉 **Conclusion**: Anyone using CityBot should plan content strategically – from flagship attractions to hidden gems. This creates a city tour that feels new every time.

# 3. How Zug uses CityBot: Interactions, visits, success

## 6,000 downloads – and counting
Since its official launch in summer 2023, CityBot in Zug has reached over 6,000 installations. Peaks occurred especially during targeted marketing campaigns:  
Marketing campaign (summer 2025): up to 150 downloads per day.
- QR codes on posters and flyers led directly to the app store.
- Use on-site and at home: 45% downloaded CityBot within the tour area.
- 70% of interactions took place within the POI area.

Many also use CityBot from home to plan trips to Zug or to relive memories.

💡 **Mini-Success Story**: The Old Town Tour “Washwomen & Bathers” was undertaken by over 450 visitors – without any additional advertising.

## From suggestions to real visits
So far, CityBot has delivered over 200,000 suggestions. Conversion rates show interesting differences:
- Sights: 1.5%
- Art: 0.8%
- Sports: 0.4%

Restaurants and nature less often lead to spontaneous visits – often because guests plan these in advance.

## Lessons for cities
- **Data-driven optimization**: Analyze which content converts best.

- **Targeted promotion**: Push less-visited categories into the spotlight.

- **Audience segmentation**: Display content by interest, time of day, and length of stay.

👉 **Conclusion**: CityBot provides not only statistics but clear action recommendations. Those who use the data can continually improve their digital city tours – and make them measurably more successful.
