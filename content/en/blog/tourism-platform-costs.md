When a destination decides to go digital, one of the first questions is:  
> *Should we build our own solution — or license something ready-made?*

At first glance, building a custom system might seem like the right way to get exactly what you want.  
But when you look at the numbers — especially in Switzerland, where software development rates are among the highest in Europe — **licensing a flexible and adaptable cloud platform isn’t just cheaper. It’s smarter.**

Let’s break down the real costs — and why destinations like the City of Zug are choosing to **license, not build**.

---

## The True Cost of Building a Custom Tourism App in Switzerland

To build a custom mobile guest app and CMS from scratch — with features like POI management, thematic tours, event calendar, and AI-powered recommendations — you’re not just paying for code. You’re paying for:

- Project management
- UX/UI design
- Backend and frontend development
- Cloud infrastructure
- Testing, security, and compliance
- Ongoing maintenance and updates

Let’s estimate based on **Swiss market rates** in 2025:

| Role | Averaged Hourly Rate (CHF) | Estimated Hours | Total Cost (CHF) |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Project Manager | 150 | 120 | 18,000 |
| UX/UI Designer | 150 | 160 | 24,000 |
| Frontend Developer | 150 | 300 | 45,000 |
| Backend Developer | 150 | 400 | 60,000 |
| DevOps / Cloud | 150 | 100 | 15,000 |
| QA & Testing | 150 | 80 | 12,000 |
| **Initial Development (Total)** | | **1,160** | **174,000** |

> 💡 This is just the **initial development cost** — before any content is added or marketing begins.

And that’s for a **minimum viable product (MVP)**. Add AI features, real-time updates, or integrations with other systems like a public transport ticketing system, and you could easily exceed **CHF 250,000**.

## But the Costs Don’t Stop There: Maintenance & Updates

A custom app isn’t a one-time investment. It’s an ongoing expense.

**Annual maintenance** (bug fixes, updates, security patches, compatibility) typically costs **15–20% of the initial development cost per year**:

> **CHF 174,000 × 15% = ~CHF 26,100 per year**

Compare that to **licensing CityBot**, where:

- **Annual licensing starts at CHF 5,000**
- **Top-tier plans for bigger destinations go up to CHF 30,000/year**
- **All updates, security, and support are included**
- **No hidden infrastructure or developer costs**
- **No stress managing the IT infrastructure yourself**

👉 For most destinations, **CityBot costs less than one year of maintenance on a custom app** — let alone the initial build.

## Licensing vs. Building: A Real-World Example

Let’s compare two Swiss towns of similar medium size:

| Cost Factor | **Custom-Built App** | **CityBot (Licensed)** |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Initial Development | CHF 174,000 | CHF 0 |
| Year 1 Maintenance | CHF 26,100 | CHF 12,000 |
| Year 2 | CHF 26,100 | CHF 12,000 |
| Year 3 | CHF 26,100 | CHF 12,000 |
| **Total over 3 years** | **CHF 252,300** | **CHF 36,000** |

**Savings with CityBot: CHF 216,300 over 3 years**  
That’s enough to fund a full marketing campaign, improve visitor infrastructure, and support local cultural events.

## Why Licensing Makes Even More Sense for Smaller Destinations

Smaller towns and regions often don’t have:
- A dedicated IT team
- Budget for long-term software maintenance
- In-house expertise in AI, mobile apps, or cloud systems

With **CityBot**, you get:
- A **proven, scalable platform** built for tourism
- **Lots of configuration options to create and maintain your brand language**
- **Zero infrastructure overhead** (we host it)
- **Automatic updates** and new features
- **On-demand support**
- **Flexible, fair pricing** based on visitor numbers — from CHF 5,000 to CHF 30,000/year

No risk. No surprises. Just results.

## 🇨🇭 The Bigger Picture: What If All of Switzerland Shared One Smart Platform?

So far, we’ve looked at savings for a single destination. But what if we zoom out?

Imagine this:  
Instead of **200+ Swiss destinations** each building or maintaining their own isolated app, CMS, and digital infrastructure, they all used a **shared digital platform** like **CityBot**.

Let’s do the math.

### Assumptions:
- 150 Swiss destinations go digital over 10 years
- 100 choose to **build custom apps** (average cost: CHF 174,000 initial + CHF 26,100/year)
- 50 choose to **license a shared platform** (average: CHF 15,000/year)

### 💵 Total Cost Over 10 Years:

| Nr Product | Initial Cost | 10-Year Maintenance | Total |
|------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| 150 Custom Builds | 150 × CHF 174,000 = **CHF 26.2M** | 150 × CHF 26,100 × 10 = **CHF 39.15M** | **CHF 63.35M** |

Now, consider the **alternative**: *What if all 150 destinations had licensed a shared platform?*

> 150 × CHF 15,000 × 10 = **CHF 22.5 million total**

# Potential savings: CHF 42.85 million over 10 years!

### Beyond Cost: The Strategic Benefits of Sharing

A shared platform isn’t just cheaper — it’s **smarter for all stakeholders as a whole**:

- **Faster Time to Market**: Destinations launch in weeks, not years.
- **Consistent Quality**: No “low-budget” apps with broken maps or outdated info.
- **Interoperability**: Visitors can seamlessly travel from Lucerne to Lugano with one app.
- **Sustainability**: Less energy, fewer servers, no redundant code.
- **Collective Learning**: Insights from one destination (e.g., “What do visitors ask?”) improve all.
- **Efficient Division of Labor**: Platform developers focus on developing the best technical solutions while destinations focus on creating their best possible content.
- **Stronger Branding**: A unified digital experience that still respects local identity and branding.

## You Don’t Need to Reinvent the Wheel

The goal isn’t to build software — it’s to **enhance the visitor experience** in the most cost-efficient way. Because let's be honest: budgets are never unlimited.

With CityBot, you’re not just saving money — you’re **launching faster** and focusing on what matters:  **your destination’s content, brand, and offers** — without having to deal with technical IT complexities.
